Personal Project
===============
This is my personal website for CIS440 personal project. For my project I chose to create a page on WordPress.com. I had never heard of WordPress prior to this semester and was intrigued by what it can offer someone who wants to build a quick website for someone that has no html knowledge. 

I didn't want to purchase the options that allow the user to own a domain name without "wordpress" in the url, so I chose to create a blog for my personal project. The themes they allow you are also professional and diverse, very customizable, in which you can purchase some more interesting themes along with sticking to free ones. I chose to keep a somewhat simple theme to avoid the fees, but it allowed me to all aspects of the appearance. I was easily able to pick sets of fonts and background styles/pictures. There are templates that allow the user to embed videos and calendars to give more function to the user's website/blog.
